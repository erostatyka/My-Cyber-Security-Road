This repository I a blog of my journey to become a Cybersecurity Specialist, focusing on the Red team.
You may say, eh another Red team guy... well here is a short explanation why I Like the Red team:
What is Red Teaming? 
,, Red Teaming is a full-scope, multi-layered attack simulation designed to measure how well a company’s people and networks, applications, and physical security controls can withstand an attack from a real-life adversary.''
1. My First step is to gain more experience within Linux - as a beginner, I'm focusing on Kali v2020.3. ( As a QA analyst I already worked with Ubuntu, Mint, and KDE Plasma). My goal is to become comfortable with the usage of the command line and most of the preinstalled tools that pen-testers are using.
Here is a list of courses that I'm taking:

I believe Cybrary is a well-recognized portal in 2020 and most of the Senior Hiring managers recognize it.
